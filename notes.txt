POINTS TO NOTE
------------------------------------
- UID: system variable: user id
- $? : Store the exit status (exit 1, exit 0)
- $# : Number of arguments passed
- $@ : Take each command line argument separated by space; useful for running a for loop with every command line argument
- $* : Take all the command line arguments as one argument
- == equal sign enforces pattern matching inside if block
- RANDOM variable will generate a random number between 0 to 32767 .e.g. echo ${RANDOM}
  positional parameters: $0 $1 $2 .. so on.. $0 stores the command which is executed and likewise $1 represents the first argument which is passed with the command, $2 represents 2nd argument and so on
- () command substitution parenthesis
- usage of shift in while loop
- File descriptors:: FD0 (standard input), FD1 (standard output), FD2 (standard Error)
- logger
- /tmp/ files are not guaranteed to survive a reboot and gets cleared very often whereas /var/tmp files have longer life
- cp command with -p option preserves the timestamps and other details while making the copy
- getopts ($OPTARD and $OPTIND)
- arithmetic expansion: echo $(( 1+2 )) will output 3
- let : shell builtin
- expr
- hash
- sudo updatedb; locate
- sudo !! [this actually executes the last command with sudo privilege]
